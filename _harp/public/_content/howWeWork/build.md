We build our projects in highly-focused sprints using up-to-date working methodologies such as Test-Driven Development and Pair Programming.

In each sprint, typically 2 weeks, we devote a small team to work solely on your project so they won't be distracted by conflicting responsibilities.

During the sprint, we stay in close contact with our clients and ensure that there are no surprises on project delivery.
